# Screen-Width-Expander

How many pixels has a screen in width dimension?

Is there a way to expand it width in 3 times? 



It is possible on condition that we will use a 'monochrome 1 bit per pixel' image as source.

In other words, the width size of'monochrome 1 bit per pixel' image could be 3 times larger than screen width,

but nevertheless it could be compressed and placed on screen and every pixels of it could be readed.

At the same time the only disadvantages will be 'loss of form' and 'addition of colors'.



To make a things work, place executable file 'SCREEN2EXPAND.EXE' in folder

which contains one or few 'monochrome 1 bit per pixel' bit map files and run it.

A set of files with 'Compressed_' prefix will be generated.

The incoming files are must be '1 Bit per Pixel Bit Map' image

and has width that must be completely divisible by 96 pixels without remains.

Cut off or add empty width to met condition before processing.
